Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a significant health concern worldwide. Early identification of individuals at risk for CVD is crucial for timely intervention and prevention. 

Problem Statement

Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a significant health concern worldwide. Early identification of individuals at risk for CVD is crucial for timely intervention and prevention. Machine learning techniques offer an opportunity to create accurate prediction models that can assess an individual’s likelihood of experiencing CVD based of livelihood of that person.

Proposed Solution

The proposed system aims to address the challenge of predicting the Cardiovascular Disease Risk upon a person based on their Habits. This involves leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict patterns accurately. The solution will consist of the following components:
Data Collection:
Gather historical data on person’s Health Record, including age, gender, either Smoker or not, BP record, past Strokes, heart rate, BMI and glucose level
Utilize past 10 years data, to enhance prediction accuracy.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, feature engineering, model development.
Machine Learning Algorithm:
Implement a machine learning algorithm, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Support Vector Machine, Neural Networks.
Consider incorporating other factors like age, medication etc.
Deployment:
Develop a user-friendly interface or application that provides real-time predictions for heart health at different hours based on updated data.
Deploy the solution on a scalable and reliable platform, considering factors like server infrastructure, response time, and user accessibility.
Evaluation:
Use techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to understand feature importance and model predictions.
Result:

Algorithm & Deployment

Test out different machine learning algorithms, such as: Optimal for binary classification (CVD vs. non-CVD) is logistic regression.
Random Forests: Manage feature interactions and non-linear relationships. 
SVMs, or support vector machines: useful with data that has many dimensions. 
Complex patterns can be captured by neural networks. 
Apply the labeled dataset to these models to train and optimize them. 
To increase performance, think about using ensemble techniques.

Conclusion

We have worked on a number of parameters in this Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) analysis research that will enable us to forecast a person's probability of developing CHD within the next ten years. To make sure they got the best findings from our study, we concentrated more on the issue descriptions and data cleaning in the first phase.
We must pay closer attention to:
Does a patient smoke? If so, how many cigarettes do you smoke each day? Whether a patient has ever experienced a heart attack or hypertension. Does a patient take diabetes and blood pressure medication? BMI (18.5–25 BMI) and heart rate (60–140) ranges for a patient. By concentrating on the aforementioned points, we can forecast that an individual will get a cardiac ailment during the next ten years or longer.

Future scope

The following are potential applications of machine learning (ML) projects for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction in the future: 

Enhanced Accuracy: ML algorithms are being fine-tuned for more accurate risk evaluations. 
Personalized Medicine: Customizing risk evaluations for each person in order to implement focused interventions. 
Early Detection: Creating algorithms to identify CVD risk factors earlier. 
Wearable Integration: Using wearables and machine learning together to monitor in real time. 
Interpretability: To foster trust, emphasize models that are comprehensible. 
Population-Level Analysis: Evaluating trends in CVD risk for public health campaigns. 
EHR Integration: Applying machine learning for therapeutic purposes to electronic health records. 
Research Collaboration: Ongoing interdisciplinary cooperation in pursuit of creativity
